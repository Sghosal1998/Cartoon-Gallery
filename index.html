          <p>Firstly, cartoons are the best stress reliever.Cartoons can be energizing along with being entertaining. 
         Cartoons can also help you improve self-confidence.
         Cartoons characters can easily impact the psychology of our brains and make us imitate them. 
         A study from Michigan University found that children are attracted to watching cartoons more than school learning.
         They play with all our emotions. Cartoon movies make us laugh, cry, and teach us real-life skills right from a young age. So why not peek to that side of your brain and watch cartoons even as an adult. In fact, they are way better than some gossip TV shows.
